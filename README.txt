This resource pack was originally made by a dude named Bagel (https://www.curseforge.com/members/bageldotjpg) and some other people. After the inital release it went inactive for a super long time, until the ownership got transferred to me and a few other people back in September 2020.

Since then, it's mainly been just me working on the pack over the last year, as a side-thing. I never actually thought I would end up updating it fully and continuing the pack's legacy, but here we are. Either way, I want to thank everyone who's worked on or helped with this pack in the past for creating something really cool, and this wouldn't exist without them.
