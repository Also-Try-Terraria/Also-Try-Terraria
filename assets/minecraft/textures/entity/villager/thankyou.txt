Hi to whoever stumbles upon this file!
Thank you so much for downloading this pack. 
All of us on the team put a lot of time and effort into this, and we're so glad it's getting used. 
I want to give special thanks to Bagel8point0, who not only started this project, but made all the difficult creative direction decisions and really held the project together. 
Another thanks goes out to the rest of the spriters. 
Yall are so talented, it's insane. I can't even compare myself to you. 
Thirdly to the members of the discord, you all are the reasons we kept going with this.
Your memes and support are what kept us interested in this project. 

This was a team effort, and this wouldn't have been possible w/o all of you.
